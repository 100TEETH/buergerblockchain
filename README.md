Open Source Blockchain For Public Affairs Political Markets In Germany

## Introduction
The theory for decentralized democracy sees a continuous market process for all political actions. As the political action is core to all public and static activity is needs the highest level of protection. It therefor has to be organized physically on a decentralized layer of servers on the internet. Such servers need to be somehow public and be controllable as being held at least in the majority with an overall interest in german public and state affairs. 

## 100TEETH
The 100TEETH UG company has a special stake in the development of decentralized democratic processes, software and servers. At the current state in 2020 no blockchain technology whatsoever is in use. This would possibly lead to a very centralized setting. The aim is therefor to build a blockchain layer as fast as possible and to move data and basic voting logic on it. Data and logic are then both safe and out of reach of anybodys manipulation. The function of a service provider would be reduced to managing a client software for the blockchain. 

## Membership
This is an open source project. It would organize itself and its members by the use of - decentralized democracy - https://blockchain.100teeth.com 
Feel free to participate in any way.

## Evolution
As though the theory on democracy is as beautiful and crystal clear as it is, there is still the need for having chaos and evolutionary selection from such chaos. For all development this should be kept in mind. The blockchain should never be a prison for democracy. It should provide protection and a place to thrive.
